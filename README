The punch-clock tool tracks your time as you start and stop work on a
project.  It records its state to a file in your filesystem in a
simple, human-readable and editable format.

The punch-clock-report tool will generate a report from this database.

Both tools are released under a BSD-like license which you can see in
the comments in the program files.
